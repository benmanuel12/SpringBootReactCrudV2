# Spring Boot React CRUD Webapp V2

Practice application to link a PostgreSQL (or other) database to a React.js dashboard for CRUD functions using Spring Boot

Initial boilerplate code generated with the in28minutes Spring Boot guide

Note: if the branch adding_database exists and is not yet merged into the main branch, please view it to see updated database code. I am leaving the functional database-less code on main branch while I work on the database code.
